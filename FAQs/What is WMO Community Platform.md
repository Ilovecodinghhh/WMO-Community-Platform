The WMO Community Platform serves as a digital hub for collaboration among professionals and organizations focused on weather, climate, and water. It offers tools for cross-analysis and visualization of data, allowing for better insights into community needs and encouraging informed governance. Unique to this platform is the fact that it is community-driven; WMO Members and Partners have ownership and management over their own content. The platform aims to be a lively, user-generated space, and offers guidelines and updates through its activity areas for effective usage.
